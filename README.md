# Python-Practice-Problems
# 1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
# 2. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 and 9.
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.
# 3. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
# 4. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.
